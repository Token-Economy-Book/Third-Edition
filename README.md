## Editions & translations

* **Second Edition (2020)** ‚Äì¬†still available in the archived personal repository  
  <https://github.com/sherminvo/TokenEconomyBook>
  170‚ÄØ+ community forks and several volunteer translations grew from that release. 

* **Community translations** ‚Äì¬†various forks of the 2020 edition exist in Farsi, Polish, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Brazilian Portugues, German, Italian and more. They remain accessible for historical interest and continued collaborative translation and can be found on the org page:
  <https://github.com/Token-Economy-Book>

* **Code wants to be free, but books want one canonical** ‚Äì¬†After two heavily forked editions on GitHub, with so many independent copies in the wild, hosting the canonical text on my own domain ([token.kitchen](https://token.kitchen)) guarantees a single source of truth that I can update instantly‚Äîregardless of future platform ownership changes. Hosting on my own domain keeps it decentralised from any single platform‚Äîyes, even the one run by our friends at Microsoft.‚Äù üòâ
